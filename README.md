# The Map of the City that Is this Novel

“The Map of the City that Is this Novel” is a proposed course to introduce
students to American realism and thinking about geography in the novel.

I’m teaching the class for the first time in the spring of 2016 at New York
University.

## Structure

The main file in this syllabus is `syllabus.pdf`, which is generated by running
[XeLaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XeTeX) on `syllabus.tex`. That file, in
turn, reads several files inside `sections/`, which correspond to the various
sections of the syllabus.

It also has a bibliography generated via `biber` using the file `syllabus.bib`.

## Credits

In order to get the syllabus to sound “NYUish,” I copied (sometimes very
heavily) from a syllabus prepared by my colleague at NYU, [Jini
Watson](http://english.fas.nyu.edu/object/JiniWatson.html). She was also
helpful in giving me a sense of what kinds of assignments and homework students
could expect at this university. Useful info for someone who’s not taught in a
US context in over half a decade!

The bravery to create a `LaTeX` syllabus using the `memoir` class was fueled by
Kieran Healy’s [custom LaTeX
templates](http://kjhealy.github.com/latex-custom-kjh). I’ve greatly simplified
his setup, however.

This structure of this GitHub syllabus was once based on Mark Sample's
[Videogame Studies](https://github.com/samplereality/videogame-studies)
syllabus, in how it is presented on GitHub.
