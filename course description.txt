“Does It Work?”

Over the past decade, literary study has become increasingly,
reflexively interested in investigating the methods that it generates.
At the same time, the digital humanities have emerged to claim a part
of growing English departments. This course serves as an introduction
to both of these currents in contemporary literary study. We will
first consider the new, different forms of reading that have broadened
the way we interpret texts, and we will then look to how the digital
humanities, as an especially method-oriented subfield, brings these
questions of interpretation into even sharper contrast. Students will,
then, see how debates about interpretation are lived and experienced
within the digital humanities, both in theory and practice. Finally,
students will learn to use digital methodologies in their
interpretation, with possible projects in corpus analysis, topic
modeling, geospatial analysis, and digitization with texts of American
fiction of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries from authors such
as Octavia Butler, Willa Cather, William Gibson, Ursula K. Le Guin,
Richard Powers, Thomas Pynchon, and Dana Spiotta serving as the seeds.
