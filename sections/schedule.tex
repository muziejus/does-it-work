Readings that are not the four novels listed above will be available on reserve
or by other means. See the list of references at the end for details.

\subsection*{1. The organic, responsive city}

  This unit is made up almost entirely of scholarly work on the city in general
  from the fields of sociology, anthropology, and geography. Some texts,
  however, have a specific literary component to them as being influenced by,
  responses to, or examples of literary practice.

\subsection*{2. The city in the novel}

Having read different ways we can consider the city as a process, bubbling with
potential, it’s now time to see how (or if) these novels play with what
emanates form that view of the city.

\subsection{3. Qualitative GIS}

As we wind down the semester, our thoughts turn to how we can synthesize our
different approaches to the text. We’ve read social scientific takes on the
city followed by novels that are engaged with New York City (and other
places!). In the meantime, we’ve been collecting a pile of geographic data
about these novels and don’t yet really know what to do with it. Now, with a
few caveats, we’ll try to figure out new paths for analysis.
